  <td>The properties of the different states of matter can be explained in terms of the motion and arrangement of particles<br/>
Differences between elements, compounds and mixtures can be described at a particle level<br/>
Chemical change involves substances reacting to form new substances</td>

  <td>All matter is made of atoms which are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons; natural radioactivity arises from the decay of nuclei in atoms<br/>
Chemical reactions involve rearranging atoms to form new substances; during a chemical reaction mass is not created or destroyed<br/>*Chemical reactions, including combustion and the reactions of acids, are important in both non-living and living systems and involve energy transfer</td>
