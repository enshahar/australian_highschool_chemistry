|Prep|* Objects are made of materials that have observable properties||
|1|* Everyday materials can be physically changed in a variety of ways||
|2|* Different materials can be combined, including by mixing, for a particular purpose||
|3|* A change of state between solid and liquid can be caused by adding or removing heat||
|4|* Natural and processed materials have a range of physical properties; these properties can influence their use||
|5|* Solids, liquids and gases have different observable properties and behave in different ways||
|6|* Changes to materials can be reversible, such as melting, freezing, evaporating; or irreversible, such as burning and rusting||
|7|* Mixtures, including solutions, contain a combination of pure substances that can be separated using a range of techniques||
|8|* The properties of the different states of matter can be explained in terms of the motion and arrangement of particles
* Differences between elements, compounds and mixtures can be described at a particle level
* Chemical change involves substances reacting to form new substances||
|9|* All matter is made of atoms which are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons; natural radioactivity arises from the decay of nuclei in atoms
* Chemical reactions involve rearranging atoms to form new substances; during a chemical reaction mass is not created or destroyed
* Chemical reactions, including combustion and the reactions of acids, are important in both non-living and living systems and involve energy transfer||
|10| * The atomic structure and properties of elements are used to organise them in the Periodic Table
* Different types of chemical reactions are used to produce a range of products and can occur at different rates||
